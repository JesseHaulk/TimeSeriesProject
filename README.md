Pairs Trading using Time Series Analysis

# ABSTRACT

By using cointegration, one asset’s value can be determined by another asset. Using this information, a
pair of assets can be traded against each other to hedge
against potential losses. Here, Coca-cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) were chosen as potential trading pairs since
they’re in the same industry space. The spread was
found to be mean reverting, which is an expected behavior for potential pairs. However, it was found that
KO and PEP are not cointegrated.
